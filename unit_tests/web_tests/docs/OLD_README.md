# Running the Web Tests

This document is an older version of the README. It is kept around to ensure details are preserved, but is a convoluted version of the current README. It should only be used for reference if the necessary details cannot be found in the current README.

To run the tests, follow the [setup](#setup) instructions, then use the instructions at the beginning of [Running Tests](#running-tests) to run the tests.

To develop tests, start with the above, then read the remainder of the document to understand how the tests are designed and set up. This document also contains a list of [todos and possible future features](#future-features-todos) for developers.

Note that unless web tests are specifically excluded from the command, web tests will be run as part of the [run_tests](../../run_tests) framework. In order to run the entirety of that framework, the web tests must be set up as in the [setup section](#setup).

## Setup

This section covers the steps to install the necessary web test components. [Python and Selenium](#python-and-selenium), [Openstack CLI](#openstack-cli), and [Testing Files](#testing-files) are needed for tests with any browser. At least one of [Firefox and Geckodriver](#firefox-and-geckodriver), [Chromium and Chromedriver](#chromium-and-chromedriver), [Opera and OperaChromiumDriver](#opera-and-operachromiumdriver), or [Chrome and Chromedriver](#chrome-and-chromedriver) is needed for any sort of browser tests. The full `run_tests` script requires all available browsers.

The [Setup Script](#setup-script) automates these steps for some operating systems.

Additionally, all the setup in [Other Setup](#other-setup) should be completed for all the tests, even if using the setup script.

### Setup Script

Some operating systems have a setup script (stored in `unit_tests/web_tests/setup_scripts`) to automate the setup.

Note that the setup scripts assume the cloudscheduler repository is in the active user's home directory. 

The setup scripts require that you have sudo access on your machine, cloudscheduler account credentials, and an account on the cloudscheduler server, which can be accessed via at least one ssh key with no passphrase.

#### Object Setup

Object setup is supported on any bash shell (currently tested for CentOS 7). 

The object setup can be run via `./web_test_setup_objects` in the `setup_scripts` directory. It will create the necessary keypairs and vm images for the tests.

The object setup replaces the [Testing Files](#testing-files) section.

#### Full Setup

Full setup is supported on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu.

The full setup can be run via `./web_test_setup_full_<operating_system>` in the `setup_scripts` directory. It will install the necessary software (including Python, Selenium, and the Openstack command line interface) and will ask for installation for each browser and corresponding driver. It also creates the setup objects.

Note that, if the full setup is run, the object setup does not need to be run in addition.

### Manual Setup

If you are attempting to run the testing framework on an operating system that doesn't support a setup script, the steps below can be performed manually. 

#### Python and Selenium

The web tests require Python3 and the Python Selenium bindings to run.

Install `python3` using your default package manager. Selenium Webdriver for Python can then be installed via `pip3 install selenium`.

#### Openstack CLI

The key tests require the Openstack command line interface.

Install the Openstack cli via `pip3 install python-openstackclient`. Set your host computer's environment variable `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` to `wayland`.

#### Testing Files

The tests require four images in RAW format and two ssh keys for upload purposes. They also require a condor file and a job file for creating vms.

Download a [CernVM image](http://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/production/cernvm4-micro-2020.07-1.hdd) and move it to the `misc_files` directory (unit_tests/web_tests/misc_files). Rename it `{user}-wii1.hdd`. Create three copies of it, called `{user}-wii2.hdd`, `{user}-wii3.hdd`, and `{user}-wii4.hdd`.

Create a public key using `ssh-keygen`. Name it `{user}-wik3` and put it in the `misc_files` directory. Do not use a passphrase. Create another public key in the same manner, naming it `invalid-web-test`.

Connect to the server. In your home directory, add the [job.condor](/misc_files/job.condor) file, updating the `{user}-wig0` with your username, and the [job.sh](/misc_files/job.sh) file.

Like the unit tests, the web tests require a server configuration and cloud credentials. This can be created using the `cloudscheduler defaults set` command, or will be done automatically when the tests are first run.

#### Firefox and Geckodriver

Firefox comes preinstalled on Linux machines, or can be downloaded from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/). Geckodriver can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.28.0). 

#### Chromium and Chromedriver

Chromedriver and Chromium can be installed through the default package manager. They may require the EPEL repository (which can also be installed via the default package manager).

#### Opera and OperaChromiumDriver

Opera can be installed following the instructions [here](https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-install-opera-browser-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-28-27.html) or from their [web site](https://www.opera.com/download). OperaChromiumDriver, the driver for Opera versions 12 and later, can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases).

#### Chrome and Chromedriver

Chrome can be installed following the instructions [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-google-chrome-web-browser-on-centos-7/) or via [Chrome's website](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/). Chromedriver can be installed through the default package manager, but may require the EPEL repository (which can also be installed via the default package manager). 

### Other Setup

The status tests require the system time to be set to the user time zone.

A GUI is needed for the web tests.

The user account on the server needs to be accessible via at least one ssh key without a passphrase, for job tests.

To modify the server at which the tests are addressed (not mandatory for original setup), the `unit-test` server url in `.csv2/unit-test/settings.yaml` must be modified accordingly, and the login credentials if necessary. The `server_url` variable in [web_test_helpers](../web_test_helpers.py) should also be modified to match the new server.

## Adding Tests

New test modules should be named starting with `test_web_` (the modules starting with `web_test_` are helper modules). The test files should be named `test_web_<page>.py`. The common class, where the majority of tests are implemented, should be named `TestWeb<Page>Common`. The classes with the proper setups (see below) should be named `TestWeb<Page><UserType><Browser>`. Individual tests should be named `test_web_<page>_<action>_<details>`, where `<action>` is the name of the action using the `cloudscheduler` command. If suitably complex, `<action>` should ideally be formatted as `<object>_<action_on_object>_<details>`. Note that individual tests having names that start with `test` is currently the only breaking naming requirement.

All test files must be put in the `web_tests` directory, and each test file must be imported into [create_test_suite.py](../create_test_suite.py) and have its classes added to the lists of tests for their respective browsers. Note that the detailed classes (see below) should be the only ones put in here - the common classes (see below) do not have the proper setup to be run on their own and should not be included.

Additionally, each new test module should contain the following code at the top:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    __package__ = 'cloudscheduler.unit_tests.web_tests'
```

and the following code at the bottom:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2)
    tests = [ <TestClasses> ]
    suite = helpers.parse_command_line_arguments(sys.argv, tests, <has_regular_user>)
    runner.run(suite)
```

`<TestClasses>` should be a list of the detailed classes, sorted by browser (currently in the order Firefox, Chromium, Opera, Chrome), and, within that, the users (super user then regular user). The order is important - the flags will fail without using the correct order. `<has_regular_user>` is a true/false flag of whether the module has regular user tests.

New tests should additionally follow all rules for Unittest test classes, as they are run using the Unittest framework.

New test classes should include the [web_test_setup_cleanup](../web_test_setup_cleanup.py) module and call the `setup()` function as part of the `setUpClass()` function, passing it the test class it is being called as a part of. `setup()` currently automatically deletes all old test setups when run (via calling the `cleanup()` function). The `cleanup()` function should be called during the `tearDownClass()` function, again passing it the test class it is being called in. `cleanup()` is also called on error in the setup, and `cleanup_objects()` is called on a `KeyboardInterrupt` at any time during the tests (using a handler contained in this module). Neither function will attempt to delete any object it cannot find. 

New tests should include the [web_test_setup_cleanup](../web_test_setup_cleanup.py), [web_test_assertions_v2](../web_test_assertions_v2.py), [web_test_page_objects](../web_test_page_objects.py), and [web_test_helpers](../web_test_helpers.py) modules. The other `web_test_*` modules are used in these modules, and should only be accessed via these modules. The [web_test_assertions](../web_test_assertions.py) module is not and should not be used in any module, and should eventually be deleted. `web_test_helpers` is also included in `web_test_setup_cleanup`, but should not be used via that module. `web_test_helpers` is also used in the `web_test_page_objects` module. 

New tests that create objects should make sure to update the maximum item numbers in the calls to `delete_objects_by_type()` in `web_test_setup_cleanup.cleanup_objects()`.

Tests should be created in a common class that inherits `unittest.TestCase`, called `TestWeb<Page>Common`. Each different setup for these tests (ie different users, different browsers, etc) should have its own class, called `TestWeb<Page><Details>`. This class should inherit `TestWeb<Page>Common` and should override the `setUpClass` method (usually with a call to `super()` as well) to do the proper setup. All details not related to the setup or contingent on factors in that particular configuration should be put in the common class. All test classes for one page should be put in the same file, `test_web_<page>.py`. 

In rare cases, a certain setup may require a few tests to be different. These individual tests and no others should be overriden in the detailed class. However, all tests that can be put in the common class should be put in the common class, where they only need be edited once.

## Writing Tests

The web test functions (modules that start with `web_test`) are documented in a more concise format in the [Web Test Docs](../web_test_docs.md).

The `cls.gvar` variable, which is assigned in `web_test_setup_cleanup.setup()`, contains server and user information read from various `.yaml` configuration files. This includes  the user credentials for the sample users. It also contains a sub-dictionary called `oversize`, which contains a set of values that are oversize for the various types in the database. These can be accessed as `gvar['oversize']['<type_name>']` and are primarily used in database verification tests.

Note that the `cls.gvar` variable is not the same as the `gvar` variable used in the `unit_tests` framework. While they both use the same setup, they do not share values.

The [web_test_assertions_v2](../web_test_assertiosn_v2.py) module contains a set of functions that should be callable within a `TestCase` class and raise the proper errors on failure. These functions access the cloudscheduler database via the command line interface and can test if objects were properly created in the database. However, they are extremely slow compared to assertions using Selenium selectors, and therefore should be used only once per test. Additionally, objects without a `cloudscheduler` command (like config objects) cannot use these assertions - they should instead refresh the page and ensure that the data has persisted.

Each assertion in the [web_test_assertions_v2](../web_test_assertions_v2.py) module takes a list of arguments, most of which are optional. The four mandatory arguments (only two of which are taken by `assertExists` and `assertNotExists`) are `type`, the type of object being asserted; `name`, the name of the individual object the assertion is about; `attribute`, the name of the attribute in the database (found via the `list` command with the `-VC` option); and `attribute_name`, the name of the particular item of that attribute being asserted. There are also six optional arguments: `group`, a group name, which should be specified when an object exists within a particular group, and which defaults to `None`; `err`, the margin of error, which should be specified when a value will be within a range, and which defaults to `None`; `metadata_cloud`, the name of a cloud within which the metadata exists, which should be specified for cloud metadata, and which defaults to `None`; `defaults`, a true/false flag, which should be specified when the item is a group default, and which defaults to false; `name_field`, a true/false flag, which should be specified for objects for which there is no name flag, and which defaults to true; `settings`, a true/false flag, which should be specified when the item is a user setting, and which defaults to false; `server`, the name of the server default to use, which should be specified when the object can only be accessed by a server that is not the unit-test server, and which defaults to `unit-test`; `image_cloud`, which should be specified when the object is an image, and which defaults to `None`; and `is_retry`, a true/false flag, which should never be manually passed (it is only used within the functions).

By default, all actions will be performed within the `{user}-wig0` group (see Test Profiles, below). The base `Page` class (see [Page Objects](#page-objects)) contains a method for switching between these groups. Be aware that the active user must be in a particular group to switch to it.

Additional files the tests may need (for example, image files to upload) should be stored in the `misc_files` directory. These files will not be committed (unless they are markdown files, which they shouldn't be), and the current tests look in this folder for these files. This is also where test log files and test downloads are stored.

Test objects should, if possible, be named `{user}-wixn`, where `x` is the letter identifier (usually the first letter of the object name, but can be chosen to be anything as long as it's consistent) and `n` is the number of the individual object (starting at 1 - 0 is reserved for behind-the-scenes objects and will need to be deleted seperately). The `web_test_setup_cleanup.delete_by_type()` function assumes this naming pattern, although it takes an optional argument, `others`, which is a list of names of objects that do not fit this pattern. Despite this, objects should be named to follow the pattern unless there is a reason they cannot (for example, they are stored on the web and need to be used by many different test users).

Test files should perform actions on the page via [page objects](#page-objects). 

## Page Objects

The test files should access the page via the use of page objects. Each page on the csv2 website has one page class, stored in the [web_test_page_objects](../web_test_page_objects.py) module. 

A page object is essentially a class containing functions to perform all actions performable on the page it represents. It is an interface through which the test objects know how to locate, click, type, and perform actions on the page. One page object method should perform one specific click, type, location, or similar action - ie, while the same page object function may be used to click checkboxes adding a user to different groups, a different function should be used to click the superuser checkbox. Actions that are repeated a lot (such as the interaction functions in [web_test_interactions](../web_test_interactions.py)) should be refactored into a common file, rather than being made a multipurpose function in the page object. Functions should also be named appropriately, so that someone scrolling through the test code without looking at the page objects file would know, in UI terms, what the test is attempting to do.

A new page object should inherit from the `Page` class, which will give it access to the driver and any website-wide components (such as the top navigation bar and error messages). Any interaction with that page should be done via methods implemented in that page class. 

Some page value modification methods take strings, while others take integers. Ensure the correct type is passed to each method.

The [web_test_interactions](../web_test_interactions.py), [web_test_javascript_interactions](../web_test_javascript_interactions.py), and [web_test_xpath_selectors](../web_test_xpath_selectors.py) modules define the actions that the page objects should use. [web_test_interactions](../web_test_interactions.py) and [web_test_javascript_interactions](../web_test_javascript_interactions.py) have very similar functions (see below). Each method wraps Selenium's wait action, the find method, and the action taken (sometimes a series of actions) into a single function. [web_test_xpath_selectors](../web_test_xpath_selectors.py) is a set of wrapper functions for various XPath locators. Some of these are described by an object they represent (ie `delete_button`, which is the button on the delete object modal) and some are described by how they find the object (ie `form_input_by_value`, which finds an input within a particular form based on its value attribute). These functions should not perform any logic on the xpath - they are simply wrappers. Any logic should be performed within the page object.

The [web_test_javascript_interactions](../web_test_javascript_interactions.py) module contains a set of functions that operate similarly to the [web_test_interactions](../web_test_interactions.py) functions, except for the fact that they use the JavaScript `execute_script` to do the click action. These should not be used without a justifiable reason (ie a Selenium glitch) that the other ones cannot be used, and this glitch should be documented in the comments above the use of the function. Currently, the only Selenium bug requiring the use of these is an inability to click on the side buttons on some pages due to overlapping padding.

Note that the use of Selenium's built-in `.submit()` method has been phased out. This is because the `submit` method only submits the form, and does not perform the `click` action on the button, meaning that some functionality is lost, which can cause improper behavior. The `web_test_xpath_selectors.form_submit_by_name` and `web_test_interactions.click_by_xpath` functions should be used instead.

The page objects additionally use some functions from the [web_test_helpers](../web_test_helpers.py) module.

## Running Tests

Web tests can be run using `./run_tests web`. Tests for a specific browser (or group of browsers, by adding additional arguments) can be run using `./run_tests web_<browser>`. Note that running by test numbers and similar as in the unit testing framework is not supported. Additional unit tests can be run at the same time, and the test/skip/failure counts will tally appropriately.

The tests can also be run by files as a module, using `python3 -m <filename>`. Run without any flags, this will run all of the detailed test classes in the file. Any listed browser flags will restrict the tests to only the tests within the listed browsers, and any listed user flags will restrict the tests to only tests using the listed users. The tags are as follows:

| Short-Form Tag | Long-Form Tag    | Meaning                                   |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `-f`           | `--firefox`      | Run the Firefox tests                     |
| `-cb`          | `--chromium`     | Run the Chromium (chromium-browser) tests |
| `-o`           | `--opera`        | Run the Opera tests                       |
| `-gc`          | `--chrome`       | Run the Chrome (google-chrome) tests      |
| `-su`          | `--super-user`   | Run the tests with a super user           |
| `-ru`          | `--regular-user` | Run the tests with a regular user         |

One can also run a particular class directly using `python3 -m unittest <filename>.<ClassName>` (although the above flags are typically simpler). While unittest supports running tests by file, the setup of the test fixtures does not allow that and will run duplicate tests, some of which will fail, and, thus, the `python3 -m unittest <filename>` syntax is not to be used. Each detailed class, if run with the unittest framework, should be run individually, and common classes should never be run (see [Adding Tests](#adding-tests)). Individual tests can be run with `python3 -m unittest <filename>.<ClassName>.<test_name>`. Note that individual test files, classes, and methods cannot currently be run with the `run_tests` script, and individual test methods cannot be run with the `python3 -m <filename>` syntax.

The tests must be run from a folder that contains a symbolic link to the cloudscheduler root directory.

The tests should be run as a non-root user. Root users may experience problems with the Chromium browser tests, as Chromium is not designed to run as a root user.

The setup script may display an error similar to: 

```
Error: CV-01749 cloud update, "{user}-wic1" failed - specified value in list of values does not exist: vm_security_groups=default, group_name={user}-wig0, cloud_name={user}-wic1.
Error connecting to the cloud. This may happen several times. Retrying...
```

This is expected behaviour - the setup requires resources from the cloud connection, and when it can access those resources is unpredictable, so the script will try, print that message on a failure, and continue trying until the setup is successful. Depending on where the cloud poller is in its process, it may take up to a dozen retries. The tests will continue to set up properly and run - this is not a setup error.

A small portion of the tests (currently the key add tests only) require the poller to be queried like in the setup. These tests may appear to hang for as long as five minutes. This is expected behaviour - the tests are not hanging infinitely, as there is a maxiumum wait assigned, and they will continue as expected.

The key tests will occasionally generate the following warning:
```
/usr/local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/yaml/scanner.py:286: ResourceWarning: unclosed <socket.socket fd=5, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM, proto=6, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 40206), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 41942)>
```

The exact cause of this warning is currently unknown. It does not impact the functionality of the tests, but it may be worth investigating.

## Debugging Tests

To create the test fixtures to manually inspect the tests, the `.setup_objects()` and `.cleanup_objects()` functions from the [web_test_setup_cleanup](../web_test_setup_cleanup.py) module should be used (passing any additonal arguments as specified in the "Test Profiles" section). The `setup()` and `cleanup()` functions do the driver setup as well, but, in addition, require the calling class, the suffix number of the user to use (ie 1 for `{user}-wig1`), and the name of the browser as arguments. 

Several functions log information in files called `*objects.txt`. These files can be useful for debugging. They should not be committed, and it is harmless to delete them - they will be automatically remade when needed. Note that these files are reused every time one of the functions that use them is called, so if multiple tests or test suites are run, they will likely only contain information about the last test. All log files will be automatically placed in the `misc_files` folder.

The primary known cause of flaky tests is the test not waiting long enough for the object to properly appear. Using the `sleep()` or `WebDriverWait` functions can help fix this, as can retrying the action if it fails. For example, the `setup_objects` function uses `sleep()`, the `web_test_interactions` and `web_test_page_objects` methods use `WebDriverWait`, and the `web_test_assertions_v2` methods will retry the query an additional time (after a five-second `sleep()`) if they fail to find what they're looking for.

The `Page` class contains a `take_screenshot()` function. This function can be called at any time during the tests and requires no additional arguments. It will name the screenshot file `<method>_screenshot.png` and save it to the [misc_files](../misc_files) folder.

## Test Profiles

The tests have a set of automatically-created objects, created in the `web_test_setup_cleanup.setup()` function. 

Additional profiles can be added to the suite. In order to do so, the object should be added to the creation list in `web_test_setup_cleanup.setup_objects()`. Any tests that previously used an object with that suffix (likely an `add` test) should given a new suffix. The corresponding `delete_objects_by_type()` call in `web_test_setup_cleanup.cleanup_objects()` should have the count updated to ensure it deletes all objects. Additional profiles should likely not be added in the universal objects (see below) - they should be added in an optional group if at all possible, to cut down on test runtime.

New types of objects can also be added to the suite, in a similar manner. A new group of creation `subprocess.run` calls will need to be added in `setup_objects()`, and an accompanying call to `delete_objects_by_type()` in `cleanup_objects()`. If the objects cannot be deleted with the `delete_objects_by_type()` command syntax, they must either be deleted in a custom method (like aliases) or automatically deleted as part of another method (like cloud metadata). Again, they should be added in an optional group if possible (see below).

There are two categories of objects - some that are created by `setup_objects()` regardless of arguments passed, and some that are only created when the tests request them. The objects created under [Universal Objects](#universal-objects) are created automatically when `setup_objects()` is run, regardless of arguments. To create the other set of objects, pass the names of the object groups (ie "users") to the `setup()` function as a list of strings.

The key setup does not have a cloudscheduler cli setup, and as such is done via the [Openstack CLI](#openstack-cli). Objects should be created using the cloudscheduler cli if possible, but those that cannot be can be created using other processes, keeping in mind that a command-line tool is preferable to a browser-based tool controlled by Selenium.

There is one additional group created as part of the universal setup that is not specified below and has no output in the setup scripts. It is not to be edited in any way during the tests, and any user used to run tests (currently `{user}-wiu1` and `{user}-wiu2`) should be in it. The real user account (ie `{user}`) is also added to this group when it is created, to allow this user to make the test objects within this group. The group is called `{user}-wig0`. All clouds, aliases, and any other objects requiring a group are and should be created under this group, with a few rare exceptions (for example, if a group test requires a group to have a cloud in it). It is saved as `gvar['base_group']`. It is the first item created as part of the setup, and the last item deleted, and should remain so. Many functions have an optional `group` argument that is invoked to prevent cloud tests from failing, and, if needed, this is the group that should be passed.

Note that some objects (like the metadata files) do not have their own delete method. These objects are cleaned up when their containing objects are cleaned up.

Note that some keywords do additional setup, besides creating the objects (in fact, some do not create objects at all). When creating test setup functions, these actions should be taken into account.

### Universal Objects
